    <title>Course Review</title>

    <h1>What worked well over the last eight weeks and aided your learning process?</h1>
        <p>I enjoyed the practice with detailed methods and elements that we learned in relation to CSS. Especially the color control that allowed the appearance of the page to transform explosively.</p>
    <h1>What would you change about the course?</h1>
        <p>I quite enjoyed the course, I was not able to pour a large amount of focus into the classes assignments as I needed to also struggle with the other classes that would bombard me as well.</p>
    <h1>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h1>
        <p>I learned quite a lot from this course, I used it more for proficiency with page layout and the use of CSS methods and  values.</p>
    <h1>What concepts were new to you, and what concepts have you already encountered in the past?</h1>
        <p>The opacity control of colors and the grid layout was new but I was familiar with some aspects of CSS control as I took the HTML/CSS course over the last 9-week block.</p>
